<h1>The GCP principles</h1>
<div class="sub-arial">
<p>The GCP principles, or commitments, have been implemented throughout Glencore. We expect all our employees to understand and comply with them. They are the foundation from which we build, shape and implement GCP-related management programmes, procedures, objectives and controls.</p>
<p>You can <a href="documents/GCP_principles.pdf" target="_blank">download the GCP principles document as a pdf</a></p>
<p>These commitments have been developed as the result of feedback from our key stakeholders over many years of operation. We are committed to:</p>

	<div id="div1" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 10px">
	<h2>Commitment to our people</h2>
	<p>Hiring and retaining skilled and motivated employees is important to our continued success. We are committed to fair remuneration by the provision of competitive wages and benefits.</p>
	<p>We do not tolerate any kind of harassment or discrimination and support the UN&#39;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights which prohibits forced, compulsory or child labour.</p>
	<p>One of our ultimate goals is to ensure the health and safety of our employees and contractors. In order to meet this goal we develop, implement and maintain health & safety management systems and programmes which meet international standards. These are tailored to the specific needs of our different operations and activities.</p>

	<h2>Demonstrating this commitment</h2>
	<p>Katanga Mining Limited develops and operates high-grade open-pit and underground copper mines. Katanga&#39;s underground mine has been worked since 1958, but a lack of capital investment since the early 1990s has meant significant infrastructural deterioration.</p>
	<p>Glencore took over management control of Katanga in 2009. As the mine is Katanga&#39;s primary source of sulphide ore, the team recognised the importance of rehabilitation for safe production. They completed a thorough review of rock mechanics to identify additional support requirements to minimise the risk of rock fall. The review showed rock support was generally poor. The team identified mine sections where support was insufficient or inadequate and closed them off pending refurbishment. They also developed detailed quality standards for rock support.</p>
	<p>Katanga spent USD 9 million on rock support equipment to ensure that the new standards could be adopted throughout the mine, plus USD 2 million to refurbish a hydraulic fill plant that significantly accelerated backfilling in the mined stopes, making the entire mine much more stable. As a result 1,900 m of mineshaft roof has been reinforced and mined-out production chamber support has been completed. Katanga has also introduced educational programmes for mine employees and monitoring programmes that continuously assess seismic activity to ensure awareness and swift response on safety issues associated with rock support.</p>

	<div id="div2" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 10px">
	<h2>Commitment to communities</h2>
	<p>Glencore&#39;s global presence and economic strength has a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. We provide employment and numerous other benefits, thereby contributing directly and indirectly to the prosperity and development of our host countries in general and local communities in particular.</p>
  <p>We carry out assessments to define appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate possible adverse effects on the communities in which we operate. We are in regular contact with affected parties and have systems in place to ensure that all requests and concerns are brought to the attention of our local management who will respond or take action as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>Demonstrating this commitment</h2>
  <p>The retirement age in Zambia is 55. As Mopani's retired miners are relatively young and eager to continue working and recognising the opportunity to assist retired miners to develop skills in agriculture, Mopani established the Makumbi farm project in Mufulira. </p>
	<p>Acquired in 2004, this 1300 hectare farm plot has been managed as a project for 106 former employees and their families. The retired miners and their families were provided with an opportunity to learn farming skills (under the supervision of a farm manager until August 2010) and take ownership of a viable operation. Mopani has provided agricultural equipment (including tractors and irrigation equipment) and consulted with an agronomist on the most effective crops and farming methods for the area. The farm, which is run as a cooperative, now produces maize, fruit, poultry and dairy and has proven to be a sustainable project, which Mopani continues to support as and when required.</p>
  <p>This group has not only developed new skills in a farming discipline of their choice, but has also established an additional food supply and source of income for their families.</p>

	<div id="div3" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 10px">
  <h2>Commitment to the environment</h2>
	<p>We acknowledge that our global operations, including exploration, production, reclamation, processing, transportation or marketing of natural resources, could have a direct, indirect or cumulative impact on the environment. The impact on the environment is often complex and specific to each commodity group or production site, which requires that our environmental programmes be tailored to their specific needs.</p>
	<p>In order to manage and limit the environmental impact of our activities, we identify the associated risks at each stage of our supply chain. To achieve effective short and long term management, we develop, implement and monitor management systems and programmes in order to meet international best practice standards and ensure regulatory compliance. We aim to continually improve performance by setting ambitious goals.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, we participate in a range of supply chains with environmental impacts which are not under our direct control or influence. In this regard, we aim to promote environmental awareness and to partner with our customers, suppliers and service providers to limit the overall impact along the entire supply chain.</p>

	<h2>Demonstrating this commitment</h2>
	<p>To ensure the integrity of our time charter fleet, our oil shipping division screens each tanker before use, in accordance with our chartering standards. The screening covers key safety and environmental concerns for each vessel, ie age, type of hull, flag, class, latest class status report, Port State Control (PSC) 8 record, oil major inspection record, the manager&#39;s history and record, intended trade, incident record, the ship&#39;s P&I (insurance) association, and status of compliance with legislation and regulations.</p>
	<p>Our chartering standards are in line with industry practice and any specific requirements of the oil majors; we review both regularly and update our standards accordingly. During the period of charter we monitor PSC records, vetting records (SIRE inspection reports) and any incidents that may occur. In addition to the standard SIRE inspections, our experienced mariners select vessels for further inspections. These provide constructive feedback to each ship&#39;s crew and managers for continual improvement and are conducted according to the SIRE protocol. Our mariners also visit ship manager&#39;s offices to ensure that they meet our standards and follow best practice in accordance with Tanker Management and Self-Assessment (TMSA). Our mariners carry out an annual TMSA audit on each manager of the vessels that we own, in addition to the oil majors&#39; TMSA audits. </p>
